Concurrent Generation & UI Update Report
Date: 2025-11-19

Changes:
1.  Modified `SessionContext` to support a list of `generations` within a session.
    -   Added `Generation` interface.
    -   Added `addGeneration` and `updateGeneration` methods.
    -   Maintained backward compatibility with `currentImage`.

2.  Refactored `KontextTool` to support concurrent generations.
    -   Removed blocking `isProcessing` state.
    -   Implemented a grid view for generated images.
    -   Displayed the original image as a small thumbnail.
    -   Added background generation capability (updates session state even if navigated away).
    -   Integrated with Gemini and Replicate APIs for the new flow.

3.  Updated `Editor` layout.
    -   Changed fixed height to responsive flex layout (`flex-1`, `min-h-0`) to better support mobile devices and internal scrolling.

4.  Updated `globals.css`.
    -   Restored Tailwind directives.
    -   Implemented design system colors (Cream #FFFFED / Black #000000).
    -   Added utility classes.

Verification:
-   Code linted.
-   Logic for background updates verified (relies on SessionContext state).
-   Mobile responsiveness addressed via flexbox and viewport height handling.
