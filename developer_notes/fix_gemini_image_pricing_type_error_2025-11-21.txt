Fix: Gemini image pricing TypeScript error in pricing.ts

Date: 2025-11-21

Description:
- Resolved a TypeScript union type error in the Gemini pricing helper for the Nano Banana image model (`gemini-2.5-flash-image`).

Root cause:
- The `calculateGeminiCost` function accessed `pricing.pricePerImage` directly on a union type where some variants do not define `pricePerImage`. TypeScript correctly reported that `pricePerImage` does not exist on all members of the union.

Changes made:
- Updated the Nano Banana per-image pricing branch in `src/lib/pricing.ts` to use a property existence type guard before accessing `pricePerImage`:
  - Added a `"pricePerImage" in pricing` check inside the `gemini-2.5-flash-image` conditional and only return `pricing.pricePerImage` when that property is present.

Files touched:
- src/lib/pricing.ts

Testing:
- Ran `npm run build` from the project root.
- Confirmed that the Next.js production build and TypeScript checks complete successfully with no errors.
