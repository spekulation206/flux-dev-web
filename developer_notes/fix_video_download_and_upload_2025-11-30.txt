Fix Video Download and Automatic Upload
Date: 2025-11-30

Description:
Fixed two issues related to video generation in the VideoTool component:
1. Added a manual "Download" button overlay on the video player to allow users to easily save the generated video.
2. Implemented automatic upload of generated videos to Google Photos immediately after successful generation.

Changes:
- Modified `src/components/tools/VideoTool.tsx`:
  - Added `Download` icon from `lucide-react`.
  - Added `handleDownload` function to fetch the video blob and trigger a browser download.
  - Added `uploadVideoToGooglePhotos` function to send the video blob to the existing `/api/google-photos/upload` endpoint.
  - Updated `handleGenerate` to call `uploadVideoToGooglePhotos` after generation succeeds.
  - Updated UI to show status messages during upload ("Uploading to Google Photos...", "Saved to Google Photos!").
  - Added a download button overlay on the video player.

Reason:
Users reported inability to download generated videos and that videos were not syncing to Google Photos as expected.

Verification:
- Verified code logic for fetching blob from video URL.
- Verified usage of existing Google Photos upload API which supports generic file uploads.
