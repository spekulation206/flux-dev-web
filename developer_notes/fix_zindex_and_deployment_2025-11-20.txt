Fixing Z-Index for Prompt History and Deployment Notes
======================================================

Reason: User reported Prompt History popup was blocked by other elements, and cost tally wasn't visible yet.

Changes:
1.  **Z-Index Fix**:
    - Updated `src/components/PromptHistory.tsx` to increase z-index from `50` to `100`.
    - This ensures the history dropdown appears above the model selector and other UI elements.

2.  **Cost Tally Visibility**:
    - The cost tally requires data to be present in Firestore.
    - It updates on a 30-second poll cycle.
    - If it's still not appearing, it likely means:
        a) No costs have been recorded yet (try generating an image).
        b) The permissions change hasn't propagated or wasn't applied correctly.
    - I advised the user to generate an image to trigger the first write.

Deployment:
- Ran `npm run build` to verify.
- User needs to redeploy using `./redeploy_cloud_run.sh`.
