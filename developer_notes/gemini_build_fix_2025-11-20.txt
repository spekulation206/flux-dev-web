Gemini Build Fix (2025-11-20)

Description:
Fixed a TypeScript scope error in `KontextTool.tsx` that was causing the build to fail.

Changes:
1.  `src/components/tools/KontextTool.tsx`:
    -   Moved the declaration of `let responseText = "";` up to the same scope as `imageB64`.
    -   This ensures `responseText` is accessible in the `else` block where the error is thrown.

Reason:
-   Previous edit introduced a variable scoping issue (`responseText` was defined inside an `if` block but used outside it).
-   This caused the production build to fail with `Cannot find name 'responseText'`.

Validation:
-   Ran `read_lints` to confirm the file is now syntactically correct.
-   This unblocks the deployment process.
