Gemini Frontend Debugging Update (2025-11-20)

Description:
Added console logging to the frontend `KontextTool` component to expose the raw JSON structure returned by the backend.

Changes:
1.  `src/components/tools/KontextTool.tsx`:
    -   Added `console.log("Gemini Response Structure:", ...)` before parsing the image.
    -   This allows developers (and the user, via browser console) to see exactly what the browser is receiving from the API.

Reason:
-   Backend logs indicate success (3MB responses), but frontend still reports "No image".
-   This suggests the frontend might be misinterpreting the response structure or receiving a cached/different version.
-   Client-side logs will bridge the gap between "Backend sent X" and "Frontend processed Y".

Validation:
-   User can inspect the browser console to see the full JSON object.
-   If the JSON contains `inline_data`, then the issue is in the `imageB64` extraction logic.
-   If the JSON does *not* contain `inline_data` (but backend logs said it did), then there is a network/proxy issue stripping the data.
