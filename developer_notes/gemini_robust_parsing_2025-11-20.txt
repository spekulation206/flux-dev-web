Gemini Robust Parsing Update (2025-11-20)

Description:
Updated Gemini response parsing to handle both snake_case (`inline_data`) and camelCase (`inlineData`) formats.

Changes:
1.  `src/app/api/gemini/generate/route.ts`:
    -   Updated success logging to check for `p.inlineData` as well as `p.inline_data`.
    -   This ensures the backend logs "Success" regardless of which case convention the API uses.

2.  `src/components/tools/KontextTool.tsx`:
    -   Updated the image extraction loop to check for both `inline_data` and `inlineData`.
    -   This ensures the frontend can find the image even if the API (or a client library update) changes the casing.

Reason:
-   User reported persistent "No image" errors.
-   Google APIs sometimes vary between snake_case (REST) and camelCase (SDKs).
-   The frontend was strictly checking for `inline_data`, which might be failing if the response format is slightly different than expected.

Validation:
-   Code now explicitly checks both properties.
-   This covers the most likely reason for the "backend sees it, frontend misses it" discrepancy (other than network stripping).
