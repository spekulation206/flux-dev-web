Updated Seedream model from version 4 to 4.5 in KontextTool.

Changes:
- Updated model ID from "seedream-4" to "seedream-4.5"
- Updated Replicate model ID from "bytedance/seedream-4" to "bytedance/seedream-4.5"
- Implemented new schema parameters:
  * size: "2K", "4K", or "custom" (replaces hardcoded resolution)
  * aspect_ratio: "match_input_image" and standard ratios (replaces hardcoded "4:3")
  * width/height: Custom dimensions when size="custom" (1024-4096px range)
  * sequential_image_generation: "disabled" or "auto"
  * max_images: 1-15 for sequential generation
- Removed disable_safety_checker (not in new schema)
- Added UI controls for all new Seedream 4.5 parameters
- Updated image resize logic to use Seedream-specific size parameter

The new schema supports more flexible resolution and aspect ratio options, plus sequential image generation capabilities.
